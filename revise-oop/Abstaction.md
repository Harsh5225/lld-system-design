**Abstraction** in C++ in detail:

---

## 🔹 **What is Abstraction in C++?**

**Abstraction** is one of the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It refers to the process of **hiding the internal implementation details** and **showing only the necessary features** of an object.

> **In simple words:** Abstraction is about *what an object does*, not *how it does it*.

## 🔍 **Why is Abstraction Important?**

* It **reduces complexity** by hiding irrelevant details.
* It helps in **protecting the data** from direct access.
* It promotes **modular code** where implementation can change without affecting the rest of the program.
* It increases **code reusability** and **security**.

## 🎯 **Real-Life Example of Abstraction**

Think of a **car**:

* You interact with the steering wheel, brake, accelerator (this is the interface).
* You don’t care about *how* the engine or braking system works internally (that's hidden).

Similarly, in programming:

* You call `sort()` to sort an array, but you don’t worry about whether it uses quicksort or mergesort.

## 🛠️ **How Abstraction is Achieved in C++**

Abstraction in C++ can be implemented ->


### ✅ 1. **Using Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions**

* A class is made **abstract** by having at least one **pure virtual function**.
* It provides a general interface but leaves implementation to derived classes.

#### 🔸 Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape { // Abstract class
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Circle" << endl;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a Rectangle" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* s1 = new Circle();
    Shape* s2 = new Rectangle();

    s1->draw();  // Output: Drawing a Circle
    s2->draw();  // Output: Drawing a Rectangle

    delete s1;
    delete s2;
}
```

> **Note:** You cannot create an object of an abstract class directly.
